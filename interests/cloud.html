        <h1> 5 things I love about Cloud Computing </h1>
        
        <br/>
        
        
        
        <ol>
        <li> <strong><u> Accesibility</u>  </strong>
        <br/> 
        With cloud computing you can access your work wherever you are, be it from home, in college or on your daily commute. This aids users to be efficient no matter where they are in the world. </li>
        <br/>
        <li> <strong><u> Affordability</u> </strong>
        <br/>
        As opposed to traditional storage methods, cloud services can be purchased at a very reasonable rate, to find out more about pricing, just visit my Shop! </li>
        <br/>
        <li> <strong> <u> Security</u> </strong> <br/>
        One of the greatest things about Cloud Computing is the security it provides.  In the case of loss of theft, because your data is stored in the cloud, you can access it no matter what happens to your machine. </li>
        <br/>
        <li><strong><u> Environmentally Friendly</u></strong> <br/>
        Compared to traditional storage method such as CDs, DVDs and USBs which can be tough to decompose in the long run, cloud is much kinder to the Environment. When your cloud needs fluctuate, your server capacity scales up and down to fit. So you only use the energy you need and you do not leave oversized carbon footprints. </li>
        <br/>
        <li><strong><u>Collaboration</u> </strong> <br/>
        Cloud encourages teamwork by ensuring that all team members can access, edit and share documents anytime, from anywhere. As a result people are able to do more together, and do it better. </li>
