        <p ></p> <strong>  Favourite Sport:</strong> Ice Skating
        <br/> I started working in an ice rink when I was 17 & practiced my skating after every shift. Since then I have improved year by year and have just finished my third season working there. We play ice hockey on occasion and this is particularly exciting as some of my co-workers are very talented at the sport.</p>
